## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open `prompt-testing.ipynb` in **VS Code with Jupyter**, or Google Colab.
2. If API quota is unavailable, use simulation mode:
 python
   def get_insurabot_response(user_query):
       return f"(Simulated Bot Response): You asked - '{user_query}'"


3. To switch to real mode later, use `openai` or `vertexai` API connection.
